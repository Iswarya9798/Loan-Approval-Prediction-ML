# Loan-Approval-Prediction-ML
Machine learning classification to predict loan approval.
🏦 Loan Approval Prediction (Machine Learning Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant demographic and financial information. The goal is to build a classification model using machine learning and evaluate multiple algorithms to find the best-performing model.

🎯 Objectives

Understand factors affecting loan approval

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Explore dataset using EDA and visualizations

Train and evaluate multiple ML classification models

Compare model performance using accuracy score

📊 Dataset Features

The dataset contains details such as:

Gender, Married, Education

ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome

LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term

Credit_History, Property_Area

Target: Loan_Status (Approved / Not Approved)

🔍 Steps Performed

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using plots

Correlation analysis using heatmap

Model training using:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model evaluation using Accuracy Score

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook
📌 Output

The final model predicts loan approval status and helps understand important features that influence loan approval decisions.
